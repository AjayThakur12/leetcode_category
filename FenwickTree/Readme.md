## Binary Indexed Trees (Fenwick Tree)

Fenwick tree supports the query of array prefix sums in `O(log N)` time. Specifically, given an array `A` of length `N`, Fenwick tree returns the sum of `A[:k]` for any `0<=k<=N` in `O(log N)` time, while the elements of `A` get updated dynamically.

The idea is to maintains the partial sums.

To sum up all elements with index less than '0b111' (presented in binary, 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed), we need to know:
* sum of the elements at '1', '10', '11', '100', which is stored at node '100'
* sum of the elements at '101', '110', which is stored at node '110'

The sum of these partial sums would be the `sum(A[1])`. 

Since there are at most `O(log N)` such partial sums, each query takes `O(log N)` time.

There are update and sum views.

* For the sum view, we iteratively remove the last digit 1 of `i` by `i -= (i & -i)` until `i = 0`. 

* For the update view, we iteratively adds the last digit 1 of `i` by `i += (i & -i)` until `i > N`.

NOTE, the node `0` is a dummy node.

In this way,
```
root      0
level1    1, 	10, 	100*,       1000          ...
level2         11,   101, 110*,  1001, 1010,   ...
   		                 111*
```
At `111` stores the partial sum at `111`.
At `110` stores the partial sum at `110`, `101`.
At `100` stores the partial sum at `100`, `11`, `10`, `1`.

When you sum up from index such as `111` through the `*` path, these partial sums are included.
