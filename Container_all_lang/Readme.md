# Popular Containers
@TODO to be developed

Available containers which sort the keys:

C++: `set` (vs. `unordered_set`), `multiset`, `map` (vs. `unordered_map`)

Java: `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `TreeMap` (vs. `HashMap`)

Java: `ArrayDeque` is better than `LinkedDeque` due to memory usage and fault tolerance.
